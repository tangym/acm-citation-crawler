acm-citation-crawler
====================

downloads all the bibtex citations of a conference from an ACM DL url

The program may fail crawling some citations sometimes, and it will not out put the fail citations' information.
So if it fails, just try again util it successes. :)

Open the output bibtex with JabRef, and browse the citations.
There's an extension which can help to download all pdfs automatically.
